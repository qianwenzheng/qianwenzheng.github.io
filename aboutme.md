![My picture](/img/mypic.jpeg)

I'm a sophomore at Williams College studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I grew up in Jamaica for most of my life and I enjoy sunshine, spicy food, and ocean views because they remind me of home. Other defining features:

- Dog person
- Addicted to green tea
- Love big cities despite poor sense of direction
- Food enthusiast
- Spend way too much time looking at memes
- Come alive in the night time
