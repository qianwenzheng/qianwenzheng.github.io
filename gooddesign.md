**It stands out.**

I chose this design because it was quite different stylistically than many of Williams' webpages. A key thing that makes it distinct is its dark background, a stark contrast to the white backgrounds found on most of the collegeâ€™s webpages.  This is for a good reason. Teach is Forward is a campaign aimed at improving the college by raising $650 million, and much of it involves soliciting donations from alumni. With an ambitious goal like this, it makes sense that the website is correspondingly innovative. It should stand out among the college's main webpages. The design lines up well with the website's purpose: to persuade members of the Williams community to be a part of something grand, personal, and exclusive to the college, characteristics that are better conveyed with a darker background than conventional white.

The page below displays the campaign's priorities after clicking on the relevant option from the navigation bar.
