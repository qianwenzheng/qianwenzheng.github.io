**It stands out.**

The first thing I noticed that makes this page distinct is its dark background, a stark contrast to the white backgrounds found on most of the collegeâ€™s webpages.  This is for a good reason. Teach is Forward is a campaign aimed at improving the college by raising $650 million, and much of it involves soliciting donations from alumni. With an ambitious goal like this, it makes sense that the website is correspondingly innovative.
