With today's globalized world, _people_ are the most valuable and diverse set of information hubs that exist. We each carry unique knowledge, experiences, and abilities; learning from each other is an invaluable and transformative experience. How can we best take advantage of that? I'm really bad at remembering names. As a college student who's constantly reminded to "network" and "make connections", the struggle .
