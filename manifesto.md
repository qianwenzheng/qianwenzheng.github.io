## Overview 

Throughout this semester, the exposure I've gained to design principles and processes has instilled in me a greater appreciation and insight on how crucial design is to the success of any project or product. The semester-long project I worked on was designing a mobile platform called Effective Giving that would help people learn about effective charities and help them make more meaningful charitable donations. Having the opportunity to work on a group project that involved applying a wide range of design research methods and making design decisions based on our user data and design guidelines, I've gathered several key takeaways that I feel are integral to the design process. The five main points that define my design process are: 
- Users will have different backgrounds and needs, from each other and the designers, and have varying opinions on what is intuitive or useful. 
- It is important to keep your product's goals and vision in mind to make insightful decisions on what design revisions are necessary. 
- Finding the balance between simplicity and creative functionality is crucial to a clear, usable design. 
- Accessibility can take many forms and is necessary for appealing to a wider range of users. 
- Having a code of ethics is important for reminding designers to prioritize the wellbeing of users. 

## Users are different from each other and designers 

Designers cannot rely solely on their own perceptions about whether a design is usable and effective because they have different backgrounds and skillsets from users that will ultimately be using the product. During the conceptualization period of the design process when designers are identifying these target users that they want the product to appeal to, it is necessary to categorize users into groups to narrow down design functionalities. When choosing the user groups that we wanted our Effective Giving platform to target, we brainstormed three groups that we think would use our product: members of religious organizations, members of larger charitable organizations, and effective altruists. It became clear as we conducted [contextual inquiries and interviews] (contextual inquiry review link) with these groups that these users had some interesting perspectives that we did not consider before, such as the value of familiar human interaction and in-person interaction when giving to charity, and the desire to help charities in non-monetary ways. We then shaped our designs according to these concerns.  

Likewise, during our [usability tests] (link to usability test review), aspects of our design that were intuitive to us sometimes confused our user participants. For example, we thought that the placing the "Donate" button, which users can click on to make a donation to a specific charity, at the very bottom of the charity profile page made sense since we wanted users to finish learning about a charity before giving them the option to donate. However, one of our participants could not find the button or realize that he could donate from the app since a link to the charity's website was above it and he assumed that he needed to navigate to that link to make a donation. 

[include picture of moving donate button here] As a result, we chose to move our donation button above the charity's contact information but below the text about the charity. 

As important as it is to consider how users have different opinions from designers, it is also crucial to keep in mind that users are different from each other. What may seem intuitive to one user may baffle another. Our team encountered this during our usability testing in which two of our participants had found the process of learning about effective charities and making donations straightforward in our app and did not need much guidance, while another participant felt that he needed a more structured guide to help him investigate charity options.  

## Balance between simplicity and functionality 

As designers gather these different user perspectives with research and testing during the design process, it is ultimately up to them how they want to revise their designs according to the results received. It is necessary for designers to parse through all the feedback and user concerns received during testing and research to rank issues based on severity and decide which ones should be dealt with when revising the design. In our Effective Giving project, for example, it would not be feasible to revise the design for every suggestion we received, nor would it be particularly wise. 

In the design process, the generating and expanding of ideas during the ideation phase is necessary for coming up with creative functionality while the narrowing down ideas in the testing phase is crucial for achieving simplicity. Both are equally important in good design. After [brainstorming features] (link to project ideation) and [identifying themes from our design research] (link to ci review sticky notes pic) for our initial Effective Giving platform, we had to narrow down our ideas and forego certain design features for the sake of a straightforward and simple to use design. A good tip for integrating functionality without making the design confusing is to follow industry standards and metaphors, such as [insert a link to a reading here] 

Oftentimes, when faced with the decision of whether to get rid of or add a feature, it is useful to ask yourself if the feature is in line with the user tasks that the design should facilitate. It is unnecessary to add complicated features that do not play a significant role in helping users accomplish their goals. Features we had originally generated for our mobile platform such as location tracking features and allowing users to send "gifts" of donations to another user's favorite charity never made it to our final design because although they were creative, they would have overcomplicated simple user tasks of learning about and donating to effective charities, which were integral to our design.  

## Keep product goals and vision in mind when making design decisions 

Along with striving for clarity by avoiding features that would overcomplicate the design, usability is not the only thing that defines a good design. It is also vital that the design of a product reflects the overall vision of the product and what it hopes to achieve. One important lesson I'd learned from working on Effective Giving is keeping in mind the goals of our platform and the vision we have for it when making decisions about design revisions. It is easy to get caught up in wanting to please everyone that designers may lose focus on what the product's purpose is. One of the main goals of the Effective Giving platform is  

Iterations are important: talk about how less and less errors/negative concerns came up.  

## Accessibility 

## Code of Ethics 

## Conclusion 

These takeaways are applicable to any design process, beyond the mobile platform project I worked on this semester. Ultimately, design shapes how effective a product is, who it appeals to, and how people interact with it. It is a continuous process that involves iterations of user testing, selective design revisions, and balancing simplicity and functionality, all while ensuring that the product is accessible and prioritizes the wellbeing of users.
