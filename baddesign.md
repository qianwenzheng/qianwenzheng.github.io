**It utterly fails to satisfy one of the main requirements of using the bathroom: privacy.**

Using the toilet is a daily activity in which we should feel free to relax and do our business in peace. I'm sure there are others like myself who sometimes find ourselves sitting on the toilet scrolling through our phones, an act that we do not wish to be judged for. How would we feel if we knew that others could watch us?

A key purpose of a bathroom stall door is to maintain anonymity. Personally, it is awkward to think that a random person who lives on my floor knows that it is _me_ "doing my business" behind that stall.

**The gap is a problem for both parties.**

As much as the people on the toilet might feel self-conscious using the toilet knowing that they can be watched, it can also be very awkward for the people outside the stall. Imagine looking in the mirror and meeting someone's eye through the gap while they're on the toilet, perhaps by accident. It can be embarrassing and sometimes a bit creepy.

**Neither beauty nor utility**

Oftentimes, one of the arguments of having a design that is not very functional is beauty, or how aesthetically pleasing it is. These doors are neither beautiful nor doing their job well. These stall doors do not _afford_ as much privacy as we'd like.
